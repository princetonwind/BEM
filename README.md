# BEM
This repository aims to provide communal access to members of Princeton University's Fluid Mechanics and Transport Phenomena lab to Blade Element Momentum files, codes, data, and information. 

In Tara's BEM code: contains external loads and centrifugal loads taken into account for eigenmodes
In Mark's BEM code: base BEM code (Tara started by writing and comparing results to Mark's, then built on it)

Tara is currently working on: induced wind model, modeling tower effects
